Disease Prediction Using Ensemble Learning

Develop a machine learning model to predict the diagnosis of various diseases based on a set of symptoms provided by the user. The model should utilize a dataset containing symptom data and corresponding disease diagnoses.

This project focuses on disease prediction using ensemble learning techniques, leveraging the power of multiple machine learning classifiers to enhance predictive accuracy. By amalgamating Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Random Forest classifiers, the system intelligently combines the strengths of each model to improve disease prediction accuracy. The process involves encoding symptoms into numerical features, training the individual models on a comprehensive dataset, and then combining their predictions through a voting mechanism. Through extensive testing and validation, the ensemble model demonstrates robust performance in diagnosing diseases based on symptom inputs, offering a promising approach towards accurate and efficient healthcare decision support systems. This ensemble approach not only enhances predictive performance but also provides clinicians with reliable insights for timely diagnosis and treatment planning, thereby contributing to improved patient outcomes and healthcare management.
